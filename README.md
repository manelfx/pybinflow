# pybingraph

`pybingraph` is a binary-inspection service and library built on
[angr](https://angr.io/). It reads function symbols from a binary and renders
per-function control-flow graphs (CFGs) as SVG, DOT, or other Graphviz output.

The default CFG strategy starts with angr's bounded `CFGFast` analysis. Custom
mode retains that graph when it is well-formed and applies localized repairs
when it detects decoding gaps, missing direct successors, stale split blocks,
or selected indirect-jump targets.

## Requirements

- Python 3.12 or later
- [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/)
- The Graphviz `dot` executable for rendered image formats

On macOS:

```bash
brew install graphviz
```

## Setup

Install the runtime dependencies:

```bash
uv sync
```

For development tools such as pytest, Ruff, and Ty:

```bash
uv sync --extra dev
```

### Playground binaries

The optional playground corpus is used by the golden CFG tests and the examples
below. Fetch it with:

```bash
./scripts/fetch_playground.sh
```

It is cloned into `./angr-binaries/`; the binaries themselves live under
`./angr-binaries/tests/`.

## Run Bingraph

All binary paths are relative to `--root` and are constrained to remain below
that directory.

### Server

Start the local web server:

```bash
uv run bingraph --root ./angr-binaries/tests server
```

Then open a symbol table or CFG in a browser:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:8000/symtab?filepath=samples/ais3_crackme
http://127.0.0.1:8000/cfg?filepath=samples/ais3_crackme&function=0x40043c
```

Useful server options include `--port`, `--debug`, `--no-comments`, and
`--cfg-mode none|custom`. Run `uv run bingraph --help` for the full CLI.

### Client

The `client` subcommand makes an in-process request, so it is useful for
scripting and does not require a separately running server:

```bash
uv run bingraph --no-comments --root ./angr-binaries/tests \
  client --endpoint /cfg --filepath samples/ais3_crackme \
  --function 0x40043c --format raw
```

## HTTP API

The HTML routes are intended for browser use, while `/api/...` routes return
JSON.

| Route | Result |
| --- | --- |
| `GET /symtab?filepath=<path>` | HTML table of function symbols |
| `GET /api/symtab?filepath=<path>` | `{"items": [...]}` function-symbol response |
| `GET /cfg?filepath=<path>&function=<addr>` | SVG CFG |
| `GET /api/cfg?filepath=<path>&function=<addr>&format=dot` | `{"graph": "..."}` CFG response |

`function` accepts either decimal or `0x`-prefixed hexadecimal addresses. CFG
routes also accept optional `mode=none|custom`, `comments=true|false`, and
`dfs=true|false` query parameters. A request value overrides the corresponding
application setting for that render only.

## Configuration

Settings are Pydantic settings: they can be supplied as CLI options,
`BINGRAPH_`-prefixed environment variables, or values in `.bingraphenv`.

For example:

```bash
BINGRAPH_ROOT=./angr-binaries/tests \
BINGRAPH_CFG_MODE=custom \
BINGRAPH_COMMENTS=false \
uv run bingraph server
```

CFG modes:

- `custom` (default): build a bounded `CFGFast` graph and repair known local
  structural anomalies when present.
- `none`: return the bounded `CFGFast` graph without custom repair; useful for
  comparison and diagnostics.

## Development

The [Makefile](Makefile) wraps the standard development commands:

```bash
make                 # fast unit tests
make format          # rewrite source and tests with Ruff formatting
make check           # formatting, linting, type checking, and unit tests
```

The commands behind `make check` are also available independently:

```bash
make format-check
make lint
make typecheck
make units
make coverage
```

`make coverage` runs both unit tests and curated golden checkpoints, prints a
terminal summary, and writes a browsable report to `htmlcov/index.html`.

### Golden CFG regression tests

Golden tests render CFGs for the corpus in
[`tests/playground_functions.csv`](tests/playground_functions.csv). Compare
mode writes fresh candidates under `tests/_actual/` and compares them with the
committed artifacts under `tests/goldens/`.

The complete corpus can take a long time. Use the curated checkpoint suite for
quick custom-CFG regression coverage:

```bash
BINGRAPH_GOLDEN_CONFIGS=cfg_mode_custom make goldens-checkpoint
```

To run every selected corpus entry:

```bash
BINGRAPH_GOLDEN_CONFIGS=cfg_mode_custom make goldens
```

Promotion never rerenders CFGs. After reviewing a successful compare-mode run,
copy its existing candidates into the golden tree with:

```bash
BINGRAPH_GOLDEN_CONFIGS=cfg_mode_custom make goldens-promote
```

Review the resulting Git diff before committing promoted artifacts. Additional
selection controls are documented at the top of
[`tests/goldens/test_cfg_goldens.py`](tests/goldens/test_cfg_goldens.py),
including `BINGRAPH_GOLDEN_MIN_BBS` and `BINGRAPH_GOLDEN_LIMIT`.

## Troubleshooting

### Optional Unicorn warning on macOS

If startup reports:

```text
angr.state_plugins.unicorn_engine | failed loading "unicornlib.dylib"
```

Unicorn is an optional angr acceleration dependency. The bounded `CFGFast` and
custom CFG workflows used by Bingraph still work without it. Install a
compatible Unicorn build only if you specifically need Unicorn-backed symbolic
execution.
